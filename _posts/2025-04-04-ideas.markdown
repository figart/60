So how is this blogging attempt going to be different than past attempts? Question of the hour right there.

Here are a few thoughts regarding what I might write about:

- These are turbulent times (politics, work, war across the globe, aging parents, to name a few). How do I maintain my sanity? Even better, how do I experience joy? What might help inspire others?
- What might some answers be to the current political situation? In other words, how do we go about fixing things, or trying to move things in a positive direction, at least?
